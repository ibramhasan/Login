In this application i use Laravel 5.8.

To open this application, you can directly download my repository by instructing git clone in CMD or terminal. Then, run the composer install, then run the command php artisan key:generate. Finally, run the command php artisan:serve.
I don't use a database or mysql, so it's not too troublesome to run it, i think that's the easiest. I tried using free hosting from github, but it didn't work. I'm so sorry.

Then, to see more in this application, you can press the singin button on it until the writing sign in changes color to orange.

Third, to look for color gradations, I searched Uigradients.com

For the search column, I have taken many references in Codepen.

Fifth, I open a lot of documentation on Bootstrap, Vue.js, Daengweb, Youtube, and learning from file documentation.

To understand TDD, I searched a lot at Medium.com, many covered TDD completely. 

In conducting trials with TDD, several times it was red, but strangely it was once yellow. Even though the yellow color is not in the TDD trial process, it is quite confusing. After that, the trial using TDD successfully turned green
